The folder contains catchment averaged actual evapotranspiration esitmates derived from the CMRSET (Guerschman, et al, 2009) MODIS satellite derived product.

Data was processed by Luigi Renzullo to match AWRA-L spatial reolution. Then the data was averaged over AWRA-L umpimpaired catchment dataset.
